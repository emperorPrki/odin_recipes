Odin Project: Recipes website

This website is a project set up by TheOdinProject contributors
where you're supposed to build a recipes website, which has multiple
pages and descriptions how to make food that you've chosen to showcase.

This is my second time learning webdev, and this time I'm making sure to stick to it!
